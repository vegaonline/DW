# Code snippets on the DWave based simulations

This repo is mainly for creating example codes for DWAVE Quantum Annealing system
for students to understand the logic behind the Quantum annealing. The idea is to understand 
 the use of Quantum fluctuations for computation, construction of the object function to be
optimesed. 

It is also intention to understand how gates are applied, how resonators and qubits play a role to 
optimse the objective function solving the time dependent Schrodinger equation.
